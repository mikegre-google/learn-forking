This is the first file for the test repo.
The origin repo is mikegre68/learn-forking.
This file was created in the feature_one branch in the mikegre-google/learn-forking repo.

I'm adding some content from the forked repo: mikegre-google/learn-forking.
I'm editing this file directly fromn mikegre-google/learn-fork. This should trigger a divergence in the commit log. I will use this to learn how to safely resolve any conflicts.
